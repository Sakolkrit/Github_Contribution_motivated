# Github_Contribution_motivated
Did you always felt unmotivated to code and publish your code into Github repo?? Fear not, this code will update your desktop wallpaper as a github contributor automatically to help you motivate again!!(Or not XD)
(BTW, I think this code will work with only in Window OS, MAC not available)
Firstly, you just need to download this repository file, and extract it into your specific directory. 
Then you need to download the necessary library by using:
```
cd "your_directory_folder"
pip install requirements
```
Then to make it automate, you need to download chromedriver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads/version-selection).
Next, you just need to set chromedriver to set your chromedriver inside User variable inside Environment variable.

And the last thing, you need to setup it by using Task Scheduler.
